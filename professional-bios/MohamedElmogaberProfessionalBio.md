## Co-op Work Experience
**Software Development Co-op**  
*Emerson* — *Jan 2023 – Aug 2025*  

During my co-op at Emerson, I contributed to multiple projects across full-stack development. My technical experience includes working with C#, Vue.js, and SQL (MSSQL/SSMS), with a strong focus on test-driven development (TDD) practices to ensure high-quality, maintainable code. A major highlight of my role was helping lead the migration from Angular to Vue, which involved planning transition strategies, and developing reusable components to modernize the application stack. My co-op experience has built a strong foundation in professional software engineering practices, agile development workflows, and collaborative problem-solving.

## Other Relevant Work Experience
Outside of formal co-op work, I have consistently explore personal and academic projects that involve applying software to real-world problems. I enjoy automating repetitive tasks in my daily life, building small tools and scripts that improve efficiency. This has sharpened my ability to break down problems, design scalable solutions, and quickly adapt to new technologies.

## Project Sought
For my capstone project, I am interested in software solutions that improve convenience and efficiency in everyday life and/ or the development process. I am drawn to projects that combine automation, data analysis, and system integration, since I believe software has the power to simplify complex tasks and make life easier.  

Ideally, I would like to work on a project where I can apply my skills in full-stack development, databases, and automation to solve a meaningful problem, whether in productivity tools, IoT integration, or intelligent systems. I am motivated by building solutions that are both technically sound and impactful for users/ developers.
